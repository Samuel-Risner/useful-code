# usefull-code
 This repo contains a bunch of code I like to reuse and want to have easy access to.
# to install requirements
 ```sh
 pip install -r "<path>/"requirements.txt
 ```
# convert pixel art to svg
 Turns images into svgs. This is done pixel by pixel and is then compressed with svgo (https://github.com/svg/svgo).
# pygame windows
 Basic template for creating different windows with pygame. Can also resize and and enter fullscreen.
