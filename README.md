# useful-code

This repo contains a bunch of code I like to reuse and want to have easy access to.

# convert pixel art to svg

Turns images into svgs. This is done pixel by pixel and is then compressed with svgo (https://github.com/svg/svgo).

# pygame windows

A basic template for creating different windows with pygame. Can also resize and enter full-screen.
