# usefull-code
 This repo contains a bunch of code I like to reuse and want to have easy access to.
# to install requirements
 ```sh
 pip install -r "<path>/"requirements.txt
 ```
# convert pixel art to svg
 Turns images into svg files. This is done pixel by pixel, meaning that it is only effective for small images, e.g. 16x16 px.

 Also requires svgo from https://github.com/svg/svgo.
# pygame windows
 Basic template for creating different windows with pygame. Can also resize and and enter fullscreen.
